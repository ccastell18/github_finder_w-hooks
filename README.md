This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple project using React with React Hooks. React Hooks is a function that helps with the state. It is an easier way to build smaller apps, while redux is still better for global state. The app is a way to look up anyone who has a github account and will show how many the followers they have, how many they are following, and their latest projects. Need the Github user name to find someone.

axios is used to make calls to the api

react is a javascript library that makes it easier to load components of an app
