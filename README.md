This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple project using React with React Hooks. React Hooks is a function that helps with the state. It is an easier way to build smaller apps, while redux is still better for global state. The app is a way to look up anyone who has a github account and will show how many the followers they have, how many they are following, and their latest projects. Need the Github user name to find someone.
